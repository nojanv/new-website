          <p>I am a computer scientist studying at the
            <a href="https://gatech.edu">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>
            here in Atlanta. I'm currently in my final year and will graduate in spring
            of 2021. Recently, I've spent the summer of 2019 and this summer, 2020,
            in San Francisco as a software engineering intern at
            <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a>, where I've built
            Agile-focused, internal tools to increase productivity for all
            ~50,000 Salesforce employees. In the past, I also worked at
            <a href="sequr.io">Sequr.io</a>, a startup in Atlanta that brings
            easily accessible and cloud-enabled security to modern offices. In
            addition to my studies at Georgia Tech, I use AI to generate and
            anaylze humor with
            <a href="https://lewlefton.gatech.edu/">Lew Lefton</a> and
            <a href="https://www.chbe.gatech.edu/people/peter-j-ludovice">Pete Ludovice</a>
            as a part of the
            <a href="https://www.vip.gatech.edu/teams/humor-genome">Humor Genome team</a>.
          </p>
          <p>My interests shift frequently, but generally tend around product
            design, user research, and software development. To sum up my
            interests succinctly: I want to help build things that are
            beautiful, helpful, and easy to use.</p>
          <p>Some of my favorite
            things outside of school and work are making my own kombucha,
            reading sci-fi novels, and trying new recipes :)</p>

              <p>Soccer matches, and matches of all professional
                sports, are intrinsically difficult to predict. As
                Felipe, a colleage of who helped create this project,
                put it, "If it were easy to predictgames, then there'd
                be no point in playing them." Nevertheless, using
                different classifiers, we built several models using
                Python, Jupyter Notebook, and machine learning / data
                science libraries (numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn etc.)
                to predict the outcomes of World Cup matches.
                Our attempts reached ~75% accuracy in predicting games.
                Given this was our first foray into machine learning,
                we consider it great success.

              <p>
                For as long as I can remember, I've always loved movies.
                Growing up, I would beg my mother to take me to the theater
                for my birthdays instead of throwing me a party or having cake.
                But there's something different about
                movies these days; some might classify it as a lack of charm,
                a more scientific, routine approach. Whatever the difference may
                be, I wanted to analyze it. Using JavaScript,
                <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3</a>
                and <a href="https://webflow.com/blog/scrollytelling-guide">
                  scrollytelling
                </a>, I looked at movies over time to find interesting trends
                and tell a story about whether or not cinema really has changed.
                In order to do so, I combed over a dataset with thousands of
                entries, pre-processed it with Python, and created several
                visualizations.

              <p>Mental health has shown an increasing acceptance and
                destigmatization in the past few years. However, awareness about
                mental health especially impacts underprivileged children who
                are often unaware of mental wellness as a concept and, 
                subsequently, unable to get help. In a semester-long
                collaboration with the Boys and Girls Club of Metro Atlanta
                <a href="https://www.bgcma.org/">(BGCMA)</a>,
                we developed a system for BGCMA staff to track the
                general mental health of the children they serve. This was a
                foray into product design and user research that ultimately
                received high praise from BGCMA staff. Our final products were
                given to the BGCMA so that they can implement our designs into
                their curriculum and campus.

              <p>In recent years, electronics have surged as a writing medium
                for notetakers in contemporary lecture halls. In 2014, 
                <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614524581">Mueller & Oppenheimer</a>
                studied the efficacy of laptop notes when compared to
                handwritten notes. Seeing as iPads and other eWriters, devices
                that allow for notes to be taken electronically with a stylus,
                have become increasingly available and prevalent, we wanted to
                conduct a similar study. Using a sample of undergraduates at
                Georgia Tech, we studied exam performance of students who took
                notes on an iPad and compared it to those who took notes with
                pencil and paper. We found that those using iPads scored
                significantly higher on our in-house exam than those taking
                notes traditionally.
